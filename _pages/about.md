I obtained a Ph.D. in Health Informatics (2021) and a Master of Science in Informatics (2018) from Indiana University Bloomington ("IUB"). I also obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science (2015) and a Bachelor of Information Technology Honors Degree in Software Engineering (2014) from Polytechnic of Namibia. Furthermore, I obtained a Bachelor of Information Technology from St. Lawrence University in Uganda in 2011.

I'm faculty Department of Computer Science. My current focus is the on the tradeoffs impacting cost, patient care, use of doctorsâ€™ time, and healthcare resources. My research takes a systems approach, which I can apply to other problems also looking for a solution from the lens of all of the players. (see more on DCCs below)

Why DCCs?.

Globally, approximately one in three of all adults suffer from multiple chronic conditions. In the US, one in four people have multiple chronic conditions, and they are on the rise among the elderly. The prevalence of multiple chronic conditions exerts pressure on health care systems. This situation is made even worse by DCCs-a situation where patients have two or more chronic conditions that are unrelated or are in conflict with one another- as providers struggle to determine what is right for their patients. To ensure effective care and quality of life for patients with DCCs, healthcare providers have to constantly tweak and balance a patient's healthcare plans. Further, to make sure everyone is on the same page, providers have to continuously discuss treatment options with their patients and with other healthcare professionals attending to the same patient. However, several factors challenge the coordination of these processes, including rigid provider work-flow, inadequate communication, disease interactions, and treatment costs. In one sense, the healthcare systems are not well equipped to facilitate these activities at the same time.
